Social media presents a source of real-time information provided by individual users in emergency situations. However, due to its unstructured nature and high volume, key information is challenging to extract from these continuous data streams. My dissertation considers the ability to identify relevant flood related Tweets from a Twitter corpus, extracted during dates relating to a historic archive of past severe flooding events in the United Kingdom. A deep neural classification model is constructed, built on the transformer architecture with a pre-trained language model base. My dissertation demonstrates that this model outperforms both simple rule-based approaches, and past machine learning methodologies, often used in past literature. Following classification, spatio-temporal analysis is performed to observe how information through Tweets develops over emergency flood events.
